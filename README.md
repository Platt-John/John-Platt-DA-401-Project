## Illicit Substance Use and Mental Health Among Multiracial Young Adults in the United States

## Research Question
To what extent do illicit substance use and mental health issues (e.g. major depressive episode, suicidal thoughts) correlate with each other among multiracial young adults aged 18-25?

## Data Source
To answer my research question, I utilize the 2023 NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) public use data, which is the leading source of population-based statistical data on behavioral health information like tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, and mental health.

## Methods
I use comparative bar plots and 2 sample z-tests to see an initial glance of relationships. Then, I use logistic regression and machine learning to see the extent and strength of the relationships.
