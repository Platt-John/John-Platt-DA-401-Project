## Illicit Substance Use and Mental Health Among Young Adults in the United States

## Research Question
To what extent is marijuana use associated with suicidal ideation among young adults aged 18-25?

## Data Source
To answer my research question, I utilize the 2021-2023 NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) public use data, which is the leading source of population-based statistical data on behavioral health information like tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, and mental health.

## Methods
I create barplots with error bars to perform initial exploration to gain an understanding of my sample, do infential statistics and create comparative tables to see confouders I will need to account for in my analysis, and do additional bar plots (averages on y axis) as well as inferential statistics to see initial associations. Subsequently, I use logistic regression and RCS to see the extent and strength of the associations.
