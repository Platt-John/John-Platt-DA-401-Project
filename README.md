## Illicit Substance Use and Mental Health Among Young Adults in the United States

## Research Question
To what extent is illicit substance use (e.g. marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens) associated with mental health issues (e.g. major depressive episode, suicidal thoughts) among young adults aged 18-25?

## Data Source
To answer my research question, I utilize the 2021-2023 NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) public use data, which is the leading source of population-based statistical data on behavioral health information like tobacco use, alcohol use, drug use, and mental health.

## Methods
I create barplots with error bars to perform initial exploration to gain an understanding of my sample, and do additional bar plots (averages on y axis) as well as inferential statistics to see initial associations. Subsequently, I use logistic regression and RCS as well as threshold analysis to see the extent and strength of the associations. Finally, I use the Random Forest machine learning algorithm to develop a high-accuracy predictive model between illicit substance use and mental health issues (if time permits).
