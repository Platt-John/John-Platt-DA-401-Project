    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we perform exploration on the 2021-2023 NSDUH data with the goals of: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Learning more about the demographic characteristics of young adults aged 18-25 \n",
    "2) Learning more about the substance use and mental health patterns among young adults\n",
    "3) Examining the associations between our confounders and mental health\n",
    "4) Examining initial associations between illicit substance use and mental health\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish goal 1, we create bar plots that reveal frequencies of demographics among Young adults such as income, household composition, and education. \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish goal 2, we create bar plots to examine substance use and mental health patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish goal 3, we create comparative tables (followed up with chi-squared tests and 2 sample t-tests in RStudio).\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish goal 4, we do a combination of bar plots with variability measures and inferential statistics to capture initial associations between illicit substance use and mental health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning more about the demographic characteristics of Young Adults, we gain an understanding of our sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning more about substance use and mental health patterns among young adults, we can gain an initial understanding on why young adults is an important population to be studied in health-related research: their tendency to experience more substance use and mental health issues (as outlined in the 2023 NSDUH national report). \n",
    "\n",
    "By examining the associations between our covariates and mental health, we gain an important understanding of confounders that influence the relationship between illicit substance use and mental health, which will be accounted for in our logistic regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining initial associations between illicit substance use and mental health, we can gain an initial understanding on how illicit substance use is associated with mental health outcomes among young adults, motivating us to dive deeper into areas where there is a clear association shown between illicit substance use and mental health."
